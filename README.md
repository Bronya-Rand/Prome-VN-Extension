# Prome Visual Novel Extension

The Prome Visual Novel Extension is a extension for SillyTavern that remodernizes the Visual Novel system by separating it from ST itself into a extension.

## Why Prome?

> Prometheus: _Boom..._

## Features

1. Easy integration with ST's VN Mode.
2. Letterbox Mode - Make your VN experience more 'cinematic.'

   > This feature can be toggled to be horizontal or vertical and can be adjusted in size and color as needed.

3. Sheld Visibility - Hide the Sheld (Message Box) to capture the moment of a given chat.
   > This feature can be toggled in the Settings Menu or by pressing `Ctrl` + `F1`.

4. Focus Mode - Focuses the speaking character sprite in chat with different animations and animation speed.
   > This feature is only supported in a Group Chat VN.

5. Darken Character Sprites - Similar to Focus Mode, but focuses primarily on making the focused sprite more noticeable by darkening other characters.
   > This feature is only supported in a Group Chat VN. This feature also works alongside `Focus Mode` itself.

6. Traditional VN Mode - Hides all messages that isn't the last message to make the chat more akin to a normal VN response prompt.

    </center>
7. Chat History (for Traditional VN Mode) - Since Traditional VN hides all messages but the last sent message, a wand button has been added to view said chat history.
   > This feature is obsolete if you don't use VN Mode, but can be accessed regardless via the Wand Icon -> Open Chat History.

8. Sprite Emulation - Emulates Sprites by using a character's character card.
   > TBH, I have no idea what use case this has, but someone asked for it.

9. Sprite Shadows - Adds a small shadow to the character sprites, making them blend in with the environment or to add a small glint of realism to the chat.
   > This feature can be adjusted in size (X and Y) and blur strength. This feature does not work for non-sprite characters using Sprite Emulation.

Most features and it's settings can be found under _Extensions_ > `Prome (Visual Novel Extension)`. Other features like Chat History will be located under the wand tool in the ST chatbox.
